# Learning PHP

### Day 1: Researching and Learning

**Resources**
    1. [Programming with gio](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OK_JCtrrv-c&list=PL0eyrZgxdwhwBToawjm9faF1ixePexft-)
    2. [Laracasts](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TF00hJI78Y&list=PL442FA2C127377F07)
    3. [PHP The Right Way](https://phptherightway.com/)

I was confused between between Programming with gio and Laracasts. I watched couple of videos from both the playlists and I found that Programming with gio has more topics covered in a single video and it was easy to understand. So, I decided to go with Programming with gio.

**Learning PHP**
- Learned about PHP tags, echo, variables, data types, constants.
